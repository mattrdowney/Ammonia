Gods, they pray to me.
Help me, save me,
Send me strength to conquer []

Hear this line from me,
In silence, deafening,
That you reap your fate [as I rept mine]

Your monologue is weak,
toneless soliloquy
That will move no impressions nor flies 

In still air it sinks,
Dregs self-forgetting
wherein your weak spirit lies

Breath, the air I breath,
Partake in my misery,
Inflict upon yourself my life

Bleed the blood I bleed,
Fasion the scars I cleaved
Upon this broken heart of mine.

Dull you forged your blade,
With no insignia engraved
A faceless drone in a pit's termites

When you ask from me
Something--anything--
That's when I tune out your voice.

Nothing you say, you see,
will ever get to me
To make me begin to change my mind
